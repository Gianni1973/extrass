Due to a limitation of Substratum, if you chose custom colours, just build & install right after and then install other extras. If you want to theme something with a gradient, also choose to apply gradient in the extras and then build. For custom bars: Madness mode = launcher icon is clock. L=launcher, + N = plus notification icon, + Q = plus quick access app, the L at the end = left side, R = right side.
