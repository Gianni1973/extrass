1) MAKE SHORT OVERLAYS: don't choose too many options at the same time or the options you've created might be always inactive. You don't have to choose all the options at the same time and you can install as many time as you want :)

2) If you want to theme something with a gradient, also choose to apply gradient to something in the latest dropdown menu and then build.

3) For custom bars: Madness mode = home icon is replaced by clock. One button mode = just home icon. At the end of the name L = left side, R = right side.

For two/three buttons mode and madness:
4) L=launcher, + N = + notifications icon, + Q = + quick access app. Three buttons = L + Q + N

5) If your notifications icon looks weird when receiving notifications, build "Fix notification dot"

6) If your status bar looks weird after modifying dimensions, build "Fix StatusB Height"

7) When you see "heads up", those are the notification that appear on upper side. Just "notifications" means the one that appear in notification center
